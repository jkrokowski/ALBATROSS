A library for modeling slender structures implementing topologically 1D beam models in 3D ambient space using FEniCSx. Included cross-sectional analysis for determining section properties.

Current models include:
* Static Timoshenko (shear-deformable) 1D beam theory
* Cross-sectional analysis for computing the cross-section properties of arbitrary shapes

1D analysis code is heavily borrowed from the formulation and example files from Jeremy Bleyer here:
