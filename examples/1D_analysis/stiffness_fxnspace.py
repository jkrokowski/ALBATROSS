# read in mesh 1 (desired cross-section along span)

# compute XC stiffness matrix at each nodal location

# construct tensorfunctionspace (6x6) for the beam stiffness matrix properties)

# read in mesh 2 (desired beam analysis mesh)

# interpolate beamXC props into mesh2 tensorfunctionspace

# construct 1D analysis forms and solve
